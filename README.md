Image Authentication with GAN Project
This project focuses on utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image authentication. 
GANs are a class of machine learning frameworks used in unsupervised learning. In this specific application, GANs are used to distinguish between authentic and fake images.

Overview
Image authentication is crucial in various fields such as forensics, security, and media manipulation detection. With the advent of deep learning techniques like GANs, the process of creating realistic fake images has become increasingly sophisticated. This project aims to develop a system that can effectively differentiate between authentic and manipulated images.

Features
Utilizes GAN architecture for image generation and authentication.
Provides mechanisms to train the model on authentic image datasets.
Implements techniques for detecting fake images generated by GANs.
Offers customizable parameters for fine-tuning the model according to specific requirements.

Usage
Prepare your authentic image dataset.
Train the GAN model using the provided scripts.
Evaluate the trained model on test datasets.
Fine-tune parameters as necessary for better performance.
Integrate the model into your image authentication system.
